üíª Local Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine:

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

A Google Gemini API Key (you can get one from Google AI Studio)

Important: Enable the Gemini API for your Google Cloud Project.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tinder-photo-analysis.git
cd tinder-photo-analysis

(Replace yourusername/tinder-photo-analysis.git with the actual path to your repository if you've forked it or renamed it.)

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure Your API Key
To keep your API key secure and out of version control, use a .env file:

Create a file named .env in the root directory of your project (the same directory as app.py).

Add your Google Gemini API key to this file:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_google_gemini_api_key_here

(Replace your_actual_google_gemini_api_key_here with your actual key.)

Crucially, ensure .env is in your .gitignore file. If you don't have a .gitignore file, create one in your project root and add /.env to it. This prevents your API key from being accidentally committed to Git.

5. Run the Application
flask run

The application should now be running locally, typically at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

üåê Deployment (PythonAnywhere Guidance)
This application can be deployed to cloud platforms like PythonAnywhere to make it accessible online.

Key considerations for deployment:

API Key Security: On PythonAnywhere, it's recommended to set your GOOGLE_API_KEY as an environment variable directly through their web interface (Web tab -> Environment variables section) rather than uploading the .env file.

Rate Limiting: To prevent abuse and manage your AI API costs, implement rate limiting. A library like Flask-Limiter is highly recommended.

Google Cloud Quotas: Set spending limits and quotas for the Gemini API in your Google Cloud Console to prevent unexpected charges.

Free Tier Limitations: Be aware that free tiers on hosting platforms often have limitations (e.g., your app might "sleep" after inactivity).

üí° Usage
Upload Photos: On the home page, select one or more photos (up to 9) from your device.

Analyze: Click the "Analyze Photos" button.

View Results: The application will process your images using the AI model and display a detailed analysis for each photo, along with improvement tips.

Analyze More: Use the "Analyze More Photos" button to return to the upload page.
